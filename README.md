Intelligent Log Analysis and Incident Prediction

A real-time AI-powered monitoring system that analyzes system logs and metrics to detect anomalies and predict potential incidents **before they affect the user experience**.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of:
- Log-based anomaly detection using Machine Learning
- Real-time process monitoring
- Predictive alert generation with actionable context
- Streamlit-based live dashboard

---

## Features

- Real-time system and process resource monitoring
- Trained Isolation Forest model to detect abnormal behavior
- Early-warning alerts when incident patterns are predicted
- Streamlit dashboard with auto-refresh and focused anomaly view
- Modular architecture with clean separation of logging, labeling, training, and prediction

 ## Project Structure:
 It has single linear structure, with the all files in the root directory

Project Implementation:
-It can either be implemented by using "predictor.py" file for a terminal based approach or the "dashboard.py" for a streamlit based dashbaord display approach.
